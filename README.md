# Red Cross Database Project â€“ CSC/BIF 375

This project, developed by the "Dedicate Keys" team for the Lebanese American University, aims to design and implement a comprehensive relational database system for the Red Cross. The database supports the organization's vital activities, including managing donors, patients, volunteers, disaster events, training programs, medical supplies, and emergency requests.

The project consists of four main phases:
- ðŸ“Œ **Phase 1**: ER Diagram design with detailed entity and relationship documentation
- ðŸ“Œ **Phase 2**: ER-to-relational model mapping using a 7-step algorithm
- ðŸ“Œ **Phase 3**: Full SQL implementation with table creation and realistic sample data
- ðŸ“Œ **Phase 4**: Normalization to ensure minimal redundancy and data integrity

This system ensures efficient management of critical humanitarian operations and provides structured data support for campaigns, events, donations, and logistics.
